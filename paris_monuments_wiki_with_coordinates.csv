Cité-Refuge De L'Armée Du Salut Le Corbusier,Le Corbusier,"Charles-Édouard Jeanneret-Gris, known as Le Corbusier, is a Swiss architect, town planner, designer, painter, sculptor, man of letters, poet and theorist naturalized French in 1930, born October 6, 1887 in La Chaux-de-Fonds in Switzerland and died August 27, 1965 in Roquebrune-Cap-Martin in France. He is one of the main representatives of the modern movement with, among others, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Walter Gropius, Alvar Aalto and Theo van Doesburg. He also rubbed shoulders with Robert Mallet-Stevens. Le Corbusier is known for being the inventor of the “housing unit”, a concept on which he began to work in the 1920s, an expression of theoretical reflection on collective housing. “The conforming size housing unit” (name given by Le Corbusier) will only be built during the reconstruction after the Second World War, in five examples, all different, in Marseille, Briey-en-Forêt, Rezé, Firminy and Berlin. It will become a solution to post-war housing problems. Its design envisages in the same building all the collective facilities necessary for life — daycare, laundry, swimming pool, school, shops, library, post office, meeting places. The architectural work of Le Corbusier bringing together seventeen sites (including ten in France, the others being spread over three continents) was classified as a UNESCO world heritage site on July 17, 2016. A European cultural itinerary entitled “Destinations Le Corbusier: architectural walks” was created at the beginning of May 2019. The work and thoughts of Le Corbusier were particularly influential on post-war generations of architects and widely disseminated, before entering, with the period of postmodernism, into a phase of significant and regular contestation,,,. It replaces the exterior load-bearing walls with reinforced concrete pillars placed inside the buildings. From then on, the facades no longer carry the upper floors, it is possible to clad them with light partitions and multiple, very large windows. He then plays with shapes and spaces, without having to take into account any alignment linked to the weights of the upper floors, this constraint having disappeared. Its main strength was to significantly reduce construction times. He was the first to use basic techniques and materials, making it possible to build an entire house, on several floors, in a few days, like his first complex, the Cité Frugès de Pessac, in the near suburbs of Bordeaux, a city made up of fifty small buildings and constructed at the rate of approximately one new building each week.",https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Corbusier,Historic Site,,

Maison La Roche / Lecorbusier,Le Corbusier,"Charles-Édouard Jeanneret-Gris, known as Le Corbusier, is a Swiss architect, town planner, designer, painter, sculptor, man of letters, poet and theorist naturalized French in 1930, born October 6, 1887 in La Chaux-de-Fonds in Switzerland and died August 27, 1965 in Roquebrune-Cap-Martin in France. He is one of the main representatives of the modern movement with, among others, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Walter Gropius, Alvar Aalto and Theo van Doesburg. He also rubbed shoulders with Robert Mallet-Stevens. Le Corbusier is known for being the inventor of the “housing unit”, a concept on which he began to work in the 1920s, an expression of theoretical reflection on collective housing. “The conforming size housing unit” (name given by Le Corbusier) will only be built during the reconstruction after the Second World War, in five examples, all different, in Marseille, Briey-en-Forêt, Rezé, Firminy and Berlin. It will become a solution to post-war housing problems. Its design envisages in the same building all the collective facilities necessary for life — daycare, laundry, swimming pool, school, shops, library, post office, meeting places. The architectural work of Le Corbusier bringing together seventeen sites (including ten in France, the others being spread over three continents) was classified as a UNESCO world heritage site on July 17, 2016. A European cultural itinerary entitled “Destinations Le Corbusier: architectural walks” was created at the beginning of May 2019. The work and thoughts of Le Corbusier were particularly influential on post-war generations of architects and widely disseminated, before entering, with the period of postmodernism, into a phase of significant and regular contestation,,,. It replaces the exterior load-bearing walls with reinforced concrete pillars placed inside the buildings. From then on, the facades no longer carry the upper floors, it is possible to clad them with light partitions and multiple, very large windows. He then plays with shapes and spaces, without having to take into account any alignment linked to the weights of the upper floors, this constraint having disappeared. Its main strength was to significantly reduce construction times. He was the first to use basic techniques and materials, making it possible to build an entire house, on several floors, in a few days, like his first complex, the Cité Frugès de Pessac, in the near suburbs of Bordeaux, a city made up of fifty small buildings and constructed at the rate of approximately one new building each week.",https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Corbusier,Historic Site,,
