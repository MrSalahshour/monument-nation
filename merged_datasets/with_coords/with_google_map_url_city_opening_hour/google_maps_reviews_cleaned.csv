ChIJvRj8ErNu5kcRfOX_xli-__I,Przemyslaw Kowalski,5,"I visited the Basilique-Cathédrale de Saint-Denis ladt year and really enjoyed it. The building has an amazing past. What stands today mostly comes from the 12th–13th centuries, when the choir completed in 1144 became the first structure to use all the key elements of Gothic architecture. But the site goes back much further. It began as a shrine built over the tomb of Saint Denis, the first bishop of Paris, and over time it became a major royal abbey and the burial place of many French kings and queens. After centuries of changes and damage, it was finally restored and recognised again as a cathedral.
Inside, the first thing you notice is the light. The tall stained-glass windows fill the space with colour, and the high arches make everything feel open. The royal necropolis is the highlight for many visitors. It holds more than seventy tombs of French kings and queens, including famous ones such as Dagobert I, Henri II and Catherine de’ Medici, Louis XII and Anne of Brittany, and memorials for Louis XVI and Marie-Antoinette. The stone sculptures are detailed and give you a clear sense of how people looked and dressed in different centuries.
The main altar stands above the area traditionally linked to the tomb of Saint Denis. Around the altar you see the oldest part of the church, the crypt, where the early history of the basilica began. The choir behind the altar is one of the first examples of true Gothic architecture, and walking around it you notice how the columns and windows were designed to bring in as much light as possible.
There is also plenty to look at as you move through the chapels, including the carved choir stalls, the rose window, and quiet corners with older stonework. I enjoyed taking my time in the ambulatory, where the stained glass changes colour as you walk.
Entry is normally €17 from Tuesday to Sunday and €11 on Mondays. Many visitors can enter for free, including under-18s, people aged 18–25 from the EU or who live in the EU, and disabled visitors with their carers. Audio guides and short free tours are also available.
It’s a peaceful place filled with history and beautiful details, and I left feeling like I had discovered a side of France that many travellers miss.",en,en,1764147228.0,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109153353968383680523/reviews
ChIJvRj8ErNu5kcRfOX_xli-__I,Seimen Burum,5,"Impressive church and since the 7th century the burial site for nearly every French monarch (43 kings, 32 queens, and other royalty).

It is also the birthplace of Gothic Architecture as in the 12th century (c. 1135–1144), Abbot Suger directed a major renovation in which he incorporated key architectural innovations like the pointed arch, ribbed vaults, and extensive stained-glass windows to flood the interior with light. This design became the blueprint for cathedrals across Europe.

During the French Revolution (1793), the basilica was secularized and its royal tombs were desecrated, with the remains of the monarchs exhumed and dumped into common graves.

Among them King Louis XIV, King Louis XVI and his wife Marie Antoinette.
Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette were beheaded by guillotine during the French Revolution in 1793 at the Place de la Révolution (now Place de la Concorde) in Paris. Their bodies were then dumped in quicklime in the Cimetière de la Madeleine

In 1815, after the Restoration of the monarchy, the remains were exhumed but only fragments in poor condition remained which are now in two sober graves. There is a splendid sculpture of them both in the church

The remains of Louis XIV and other kings, queens and other royalty were recovered from the mass graves of the revolution, identified in so far possible and placed in two ossuaries in the basilica's crypt. For Louis XIV there is a cenotaph

Entry is € 17,- but that is well worth it as you get a lot of French history and at the end there is an interesting small artisan village with trades related to the church restoration and a large video presentation.",en,en,1762983624.0,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117451913948902098328/reviews

ChIJPRDmPeBx5kcRcHXvvsDvU9c,Cláudio Cardona,3,"The Hôtel de Sully is a historic stop in the Marais that is as understated as it is charming. Built in the 17th century, this mansion offers a glimpse into Louis XIII architecture, with its intricately designed facade, quiet courtyard, and manicured garden. While it may not captivate for long, it provides a brief escape from the bustling streets of Paris.

The highlight of visiting is the hidden passageway that connects Rue Saint-Antoine to the iconic Place des Vosges. Walking through the courtyard and emerging into the historic square adds a sense of discovery to your exploration of the Marais. The garden is peaceful, but not particularly remarkable, and while the architecture is beautiful, it doesn’t demand more than a few moments of attention.

The Hôtel de Sully also houses the Centre des Monuments Nationaux, which can be of interest for those curious about French heritage, though it’s a small feature that may not appeal to everyone.

While the Hôtel de Sully is a pleasant addition to a Marais itinerary, it’s not a must-see. It’s best appreciated as a quick detour on your way to Place des Vosges or as a quiet stop amid a busy day of exploring the neighborhood.

Previously the location of the infamous Bastille Prison which was destroyed during the early days of the French Revolution. What you find here is a bronze column, topped by a gilded figure - the Genius of Liberty'. The base of the column includes decorative bas-reliefs which are not easy to see from afar.

Unfortunately, the monument is surrounded by a busy roundabout, making it less convenient to view up close. However, you can have a good look from the street intersections that lead to the square.

We had a lovely meal in the restaurant at a reasonable price.
The visit route takes you to the top floor first, then brings you down. We were advised, by a guide, to unhook the rope on the second floor and not proceed to the top as the stairs are much more uneven and my sister walks with a stick. I continued to the top, but she, wisely, followed the advice. I have to endorse what the guide told us; for anyone not too steady on their feet, do stop at the first floor.
The rooms are furnished; particularly the ground floor which makes the chateau very homely. It is not a grand or pompous place, you can imagine a family living there!
The chateau is surrounded by lovely parkland, which we didn't explore as my sister had walked as far as the day permitted and we still needed to return to the car park.

Further out into the courtyard around the church, one encounters silence , an architecture that does not shout, but whispers of proportion, light, and shadow. Here, each step becomes a meditation on how humanity shapes spaces for the sacred.

In the olive production, where soil and labor are joined, one is reminded of the rhythm of monastic life: prayer and work, ora et labora. The roots of the olive trees reach deep, as if searching for what lies hidden in the frost the quiet force that carries both fruit and history.

And finally, the magnificent jar. A simple vessel, yet also a symbol: humanity’s attempt to give form to what would otherwise slip away. Here, clay becomes a mirror of our own existence, fragile, yet filled with meaning.

Thoronet is not merely a visit; it is a reminder that simplicity can be the most enduring. Perhaps something we ought to reflect on more today.",en,en,1763394033.0,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112189765094448260018/reviews

You can see the big Frioul Island on one side and the city of Marseille on the other. It’s always a treat to watch the big cruise ships and small boats passing by.

ChIJFZv_M7_AyRIRfr31NFtB3RA,Kyle Johnson,5,"Okay, so the Château d'If is this really famous old castle right off the coast of Marseille. The main thing you gotta know is that it's famous because of the book, The Count of Monte Cristo, which used it as the ultimate prison.

King Francis I built it way back in the 16
th
century to protect the coast, but it ended up being this crazy, inescapable state prison—basically France's version of Alcatraz.

You take a quick boat ride from the Old Port to get there, and the minute you see it on the island, it looks super isolated. The view of Marseille from the top is awesome, but the best part is walking around the cells. They even have the fictional one for Edmond Dantès, which is cool. You learn that if you were rich, you got a nice cell (called a ""pistole"" cell) with a window and fireplace. But if you were poor, you were stuck in a dark, gross dungeon. It's a total must-see if you love that book or just want to explore a spooky piece of history.",en,en,1760469883.0,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115543325512708619474/reviews

ChIJJQ3W7CmJ6EcRhyFLlYePOJM,Donbhupi,5,"This museum came into existence fairly recently (2023). However the château that hosts this museum exists from the 16th century; started by François 1er and designed by some of the same architects that designed the Louvre and some parts of Versailles.
If you're passionate about all aspects of the french language including but not limited to art, history, geography, phonetics, vocabulary, slang, this museum is definitely the place for that kind of immersion. Their website says 2 hours is the average required time but I'd say plan for at least 4 hours if you're the researcher, overthinker type that likes to dive deeper into silly things such as why this painting(cf photo) is titled LHOOQ. Plenty of fun activities to do too.

We took a group of about 15-16 students of ours to an excursion here. Also I just realized how ironic it is that I write this review in English but I guess it's more important that more french learners understand why they should visit; if I wrote it in french, it won't likely reach the beginners.

ChIJqY3nI9iFB0gRuaT9__IpkMY,Georgina Fufa,5,"I reviewed this castle 10 months ago, and gave it 4 stars for the reasons listed below. However, it comes to mind more often than any other place I went to in the Loire Valley and I think of it when I visit house or castles in other countries because it really is one of the most impressive places I've been to. For that reason, I've upped it to 5 stars.

I loved the castle rooms without the furniture because you can appreciate the space, walls, floor and ceilings so much more. Many other castles have furniture. We basically had the place to ourselves which made it special too (I don't think it gets that busy during the week in September). However, I would agree with comments from others:
1) Where is the information about the rooms? There are leaflets available but they focus on the art in the rooms rather than going into more detail about the original space.
2) you've got to like contemporary art, but actually it didn't detract from the visit for me.
3) where is the information about the owners? There is some, but I think it could be better.
In spite of that, definitely go. It's really worth it. They have picnic tables inside too.",en,en,1752788887.0,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101467224551717292862/reviews

5 stars because of the beautiful scenery, history, and overall peaceful vibe of the place. There are just a few things to keep in mind if you are a foreigner. (Well, much like me.)

FOR THOSE PLANNING TO GO:
1. They don't really speak English
2. Getting here is a bit difficult, as the language barrier kinda gets worse and worse, but it's definitely doable.
3. If you join a tour guide around the house, she (at least in our case) will not speak English.
4. You CAN get your own copy of George Sand's published works!
(SIDENOTE: To get to Nohant in the first place, you will be dropped off in the middle of a field, with a small sign. Nohant does NOT have a big entrance to the town)

OVERALL: Should you go?
If you are a fan of Chopin and George Sand's lives together, yes. However, it is also best that you look up Sand's children, Solange And Maurice. Just knowing their backgrounds will be useful, and will make your expereince better.

If you aren't a fan of Chopin and Sand,  you might find it boring. (The blue room in the pictures below is Sand's room, where she died.)",en,en,1728791995.0,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101215347473072905805/reviews

ChIJR3122B9u5kcRaCck3PlB9DM,Amrit Das,5,"•	A Gothic masterpiece: Built between 1242 and 1248 by King Louis IX (Saint Louis) to house precious Christian relics — including the Crown of Thorns — Sainte-Chapelle is one of the finest examples of Rayonnant Gothic architecture.
•	Unforgettable stained glass: The upper chapel features 15 towering stained-glass windows, each over 15 meters tall, illustrating more than 1,100 biblical scenes. When sunlight filters through, the entire space glows in a kaleidoscope of reds, blues, and purples — an experience visitors often describe as “spiritual” or “otherworldly.”
•	Compact yet awe-inspiring: Unlike sprawling cathedrals, Sainte-Chapelle is intimate. You don’t just see it — you feel it envelop you in color and light.
•	Central location: Located on the Île de la Cité, next to the Palais de Justice and a few steps from Notre-Dame, it’s easy to combine with other major Paris attractions.
•	Historical significance: As the private royal chapel of the French kings, it represents both religious devotion and the peak of medieval artistry.

⸻

⚠️ Things to keep in mind
•	Crowds and queues: Sainte-Chapelle is small and extremely popular — lines form early, and the chapel can feel packed, especially mid-day.
•	Security checks: Entry is through the Palais de Justice complex, so airport-style security applies. Arrive early to avoid delays.
•	Limited visit time: The experience, while stunning, is short — most visitors spend about 30–45 minutes inside.
•	Lighting conditions vary: The stained glass looks best on sunny days (late morning to mid-afternoon). On cloudy days, colors appear softer and less vivid but still atmospheric.
•	Lower chapel first: The entrance leads you through the modest lower chapel before you ascend to the breathtaking upper chapel — don’t rush; the contrast enhances the reveal.",en,en,1761132162.0,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100609440504464861477/reviews

Each panel tells a story from the Bible, creating a sense of awe and serenity unlike anywhere else.

The upper chapel is especially mesmerizing, with its towering windows and intricate details that make you feel as if you’re standing inside a jewel box. Don’t let the long line discourage you — it’s absolutely worth the wait.

ChIJR3122B9u5kcRaCck3PlB9DM,Przemyslaw Kowalski,5,"Visiting Sainte-Chapelle was honestly one of the highlights of my trip to Paris. It’s tucked away on the Île de la Cité, inside the Palais de Justice complex, so from the outside it doesn’t look like much. But the moment you walk upstairs into the main chapel, it’s breathtaking — the entire space glows with color.
The chapel was built in the 13th century by King Louis IX, who wanted a special place to keep religious relics, including what was believed to be the Crown of Thorns. Knowing that history makes the place feel even more meaningful.
There are two levels inside. The lower chapel is peaceful, with painted arches and golden stars on the ceiling, but it’s the upper chapel that truly amazed me. The walls are almost entirely made of stained glass, and when the sunlight shines through, the whole room is filled with red, blue, and violet light. It’s one of those moments where you just stand still and stare — photos don’t do it justice.
I went in the late morning on a sunny day, and the light was perfect. It can get a bit crowded, but the atmosphere is still very calm, almost spiritual. The visit doesn’t take long — maybe 30 to 45 minutes — but it stays with you.

This is the atmosphere that the last owner, marquise de Maillé, wished to preserve at the castle. In the early 1970s, she transferred the estate and the park of over 1,000 hectares to the French State as she had no direct heirs left.

This was a perfect solution to preserve the interiors and furnishings that the marquise and her father had spent dozens of years on (re)creating and not let history repeat itself at the end of the 18th century when, following the death of the manor's founder, the last Minister of Finance under Louis XV, and the ensuing Revolution, the castle fell into disrepair for more than a century.

Now this mid-18th-century ""hunting lodge"" together with the park makes a very pleasant impression, so I think Colin Firth and Miloš Forman spent a wonderful time here in the late 1980s working on the film ""Valmont"".",en,en,1674740135.0,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103337159842479307612/reviews

The price is around 8 euros, I think, and it's worth it because it also includes climbing the cathedral tower. The tour is only offered in French, and they give you a poorly translated brochure. Some paragraphs don't even match up with the one before or after, so I took the tour and explained that I didn't understand the language but was interested in seeing the crypt. They agreed. The guide knew I wouldn't pay attention and would just be taking pictures. So if you're going to take the tour, tell the guide about that, because they make some really awful faces! The crypt is beautiful; only remnants of its former splendor remain. It's incredible how great treasures were lost in France due to its wars, and this was no exception. Here in the crypt, we can see the first crypt of Romanesque origin, where the relics of Saint-Etienne were displayed in their heyday. We can also see the remains of a Renaissance burial, the recumbent effigy of the Duke of Berry, as well as the tombs of numerous archbishops and some fragments of the famous screen dating from the 13th century, which separated the choir and the nave.

Even with clouds and no sunshine, the inside is bright enough to see through the painted glasses of the windows. They are marvelous piece of art.

If you have the chance to be in the area, you should take the time to walk there and look for yourself how gigantic and stunning it is.

What actually surprised me the most is how modern they are inside. They have contactless payment card machine for donation at each corner of the cathedral. So if you don't have coins like me, you can still use your card to pay to lit a candle or novena.

The hours of the priest are written on a card board inside.

The confessional is brightly litten and has a priest waiting inside for anyone who wants to confess theirs sins. This is unseen for me before today in France.

There is also a treasury room which you have to pay to access it.  Overall a great place to visit.

ChIJlYA6J0QM5EcRISiIn2K1IBs,S. Duparc,5,"A Stunning Journey Through Time: My Review of Chartres Cathedral
Nestled in the charming town of Chartres, just southwest of Paris, France, the Chartres Cathedral (officially known as the Cathedral of Our Lady of Chartres) stands as an awe-inspiring testament to medieval ingenuity and faith. This Gothic masterpiece, a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1979, draws visitors from around the world with its soaring spires, intricate sculptures, and unparalleled stained-glass windows that seem to glow with divine light. If you’re a history buff, architecture enthusiast, or simply someone seeking a profound cultural experience, this cathedral should top your list.
Construction began in the 12th century after a fire destroyed much of the previous Romanesque structure in 1194, with the current form largely completed by 1220—a remarkably swift timeline for such an ambitious project. Measuring about 130 meters long and with towers reaching up to 115 meters, it’s one of the best-preserved examples of High Gothic architecture. The facade alone is a storyteller’s dream, adorned with over 2,000 sculpted figures depicting biblical scenes, saints, and everyday medieval life. As you approach, the asymmetrical towers—one flamboyant and ornate, the other more restrained—create a sense of dynamic balance that pulls you in.
Stepping inside is like entering a kaleidoscope of color and light. The cathedral boasts 176 stained-glass windows, covering nearly 2,600 square meters, most dating back to the 13th century and miraculously surviving wars and revolutions. The famous “Blue Virgin” window, with its vibrant cobalt hues, is a highlight, symbolizing the cathedral’s deep Marian devotion. On a sunny day, the interior transforms into a symphony of reds, blues, and golds filtering through the glass, casting ethereal patterns on the stone floor. Don’t miss the labyrinth etched into the nave’s pavement—a 13th-century pilgrimage path that visitors can still walk today, especially on Fridays when the chairs are cleared.
From a visitor’s perspective, Chartres offers an immersive experience that’s both educational and spiritual. I recommend joining a guided tour, such as those led by experts like Malcolm Miller (or using his book as a companion), to decode the symbolism in the windows and portals—it’s like unlocking a medieval code. Many travelers rave about spending hours here, mesmerized by the details; one recent account described it as “breathtakingly beautiful” with “magnificent Gothic architecture” that leaves you in awe. Entry is free, though donations are appreciated, and climbing the north tower (for a small fee) rewards you with panoramic views of the surrounding countryside. It’s easily accessible by train from Paris (about an hour), making it a perfect day trip. Just note that restoration work, ongoing since the 2010s, might occasionally obscure parts, but it ensures this gem shines for future generations.
In a world of modern wonders, Chartres Cathedral reminds us of humanity’s capacity for beauty and endurance. Whether you’re there for the art, history, or quiet reflection, it delivers an unforgettable punch. I give it a solid 5 out of 5—absolutely worth the pilgrimage!",en,en,1765303153.0,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105584515949872813478/reviews

Because you may 'discover' something interesting later that you may want to visit 😎.
Mont Saint Michael was one such place that I 'discovered' when I was in Paris.
The visit to the Mont took the whole day (12 hours), but it was worth it. 😊
I had booked the day tour with the 'Paris City Vision' tour company.
And everything about this Fairytale Castle on a tidal, magical, holy island turned out to be awesome.....a perfect blend of natural and man made beauty.
From the car parking area, which was about 2.5 km from the walkway bridge to the Castle, shuttle buses were available, although you can walk all the way if you want.
Carrying an umbrella did help ☂️ as it was hot and sunny.
During the French Revolution, the Castle was nationalized, and monks who had settled here as early as 966 CE were expelled.
The Castle also served as a prison for some time.
However, after the celebration of 1000 years of its foundation, some monks again moved in and started residing in the Castle.
So there does exist a very small French commune here; with a mayor, priest, postman, and police !
The bay of Mont Saint Michael, covering an area of about 500 square km, boasts of the highest tides in Europe, and those who want to experience the tides can plan their visits accordingly.
Be prepared to climb lots of stairs.

You only get access to the first floor and one room on the basement level.  There are some beautiful floors - tiles and parquet. l;ots of interesting informationon boards to read on your way round.  The local authority gave the owners some money to help with restoration but it now is in desperate need of a new roof.  Anything that is given is going towards that.  You can see the effects of some slight water damage on walls so I hope they manage to get this fixed before the damage becomes more extensive.
We walked up to the Dauphins Dairy a separate building built for Marie Antoinette.  It was OK.  Not a great deal to see inside.
Then we walked ujp  to the shell house which was amazing.  E verwhere on the walls and ceiling is covered entirely with shells of all different kinds.  I thought it must have taken ages to do but apparently it was all done within a year.

Enter through the underground passage — much safer than crossing the roundabout — and today being Sunday, entrance was free, which was a great bonus.

It was raining on and off, but that didn’t take away from the experience at all. In fact, reaching the top was the highlight of the day. The 360° views of Paris are incredible, and seeing the Eiffel Tower from above feels completely different from seeing it at street level.

For anyone visiting — even if you’ve been to Paris multiple times — going up the Arc is absolutely worth it. It offers a fresh perspective on the city and some of the best photo spots you’ll find.

【Purpose of Visit】Perfect for an evening visit, especially for night view appreciation, right after checking in on your arrival day.

✅ Experience (Highlights)
After a flight from Tokyo, we checked into the hotel around 4 PM and headed straight to the iconic Arc de Triomphe.

* ✅ The View from the Arc: While the illuminated Arc de Triomphe itself is grand and full of charm, **the Eiffel Tower's sparkle illumination (Champagne Flash) seen clearly from the top of the Arc is truly unmissable.**
* By visiting during the transition from dusk to night, we enjoyed a complete panorama: the grandeur of the Arc, the lights along the Champs-Élysées, and the dazzling sparkle of the Eiffel Tower.

* ✅ Final Impression: I believe everyone who witnesses this view will fall in love with Paris. It was a magical moment—the highlight of a perfect Parisian evening.",en,en,1762630328.0,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118063054786331074679/reviews

Built in the 1920s as a gesture of gratitude to Muslim soldiers from French colonies who fought in World War I, this mosque is both a place of worship and a powerful symbol of interfaith respect and multicultural presence in Europe.

The architecture is inspired by Moorish styles, particularly those of North Africa and Andalusia, featuring stunning green-tiled minarets, carved wooden ceilings, graceful arches, and peaceful courtyards. The central courtyard, with its fountains and mosaics, offers a tranquil escape from the busy Parisian streets—a place where visitors can pause, reflect, or simply admire the craftsmanship and beauty.

Beyond its religious significance, the mosque also serves as a cultural center. It includes a traditional hammam (bathhouse), a beautiful tea room that serves mint tea and North African pastries, and a restaurant offering exquisite Algerian cuisine. These experiences provide a window into Islamic culture and hospitality.

ChIJpdzLF9px5kcR_lcYOEdaets,Azar,5,"The Church of Saint-Sulpice, located in the fashionable 6th arrondissement of Paris, is one of the most significant and largest churches in the city, second only to Notre-Dame in size. Its construction took more than 130 years, from 1646 to 1780, and involved several architects, resulting in a distinctive blend of Baroque and Classical styles. The church was originally built on the site of an older 12th-century Romanesque church.
The building's facade remains unfinished, lacking one of its planned towers, giving it a unique, somewhat asymmetrical appearance. The interior is striking in its scale and austere elegance.
The main treasures inside are the frescoes by Eugène Delacroix, located in the first chapel on the right.
Another unique artifact is the gnomon, an astronomical instrument created in the 18th century to accurately determine the date of Easter.

ChIJEU7r8_lx5kcRgylm7D8Avm4,Azar,4,"The Arenas of Lutetia are one of the rare surviving traces of Roman antiquity in Paris: the amphitheater was built in the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, when the city was called Lutetia and was under the rule of the Roman Empire.
The arenas were created as a multifunctional space for gladiator fights, theatrical performances, and public gatherings, and they could accommodate up to fifteen thousand spectators.
The arenas of Lutetia were partially destroyed in the late 3rd century, around 275 AD, during the Germanic (Frankish and Alamanic) raids on Lutetia, and they were never rebuilt. They were subsequently abandoned and remained hidden beneath the city for a long time, until they were rediscovered during the construction of the Rue Monge in the 19th century, sparking a wave of interest among Parisian intellectuals, including Victor Hugo, who advocated for the preservation and restoration of the monument.
Today, the arenas are open to the public and serve as a peaceful urban space where you can see the remains of the ancient walls, the stage platform, and the spectator seats. However, much of the structure has been lost, and it would be great to restore it to experience the atmosphere of Roman Lutetia and the fascinating history of its disappearance and rebirth.

ChIJyw3L3i1x5kcR9ordQIU7KD4,Thomas Lebel,2,"An urban forest? I'm very skeptical.

The very term ""urban forest"" is more of a public relations exercise than a tangible scientific reality. With only 470 trees planted in a limited area, this project objectively resembles a dense thicket or an inaccessible square more than a truly self-sustaining forest ecosystem. The term is considered misleading, even bordering on semantic fraud, by some observers in the field (Source: Batirama, ""Paris and its urban forest craze,"" January 21, 2025).

The project's long-term biological viability raises legitimate technical skepticism due to the significant constraints of the subsoil. The presence of underground infrastructure such as the metro and parking garages drastically limits the available soil depth, transforming the area into a complex green roof where the long-term development of large trees remains uncertain (Source: Institut Paris Région, ""Urban Micro-forests: Ecological Functions to Evaluate,"" May 13, 2025).

From a functional standpoint, the change in the traffic pattern, from a roundabout to a horseshoe shape, has created problematic disruptions in traffic flow. The redesign has created discontinuities for cyclists and congestion points for motorists, complicating local transit instead of improving its flow (Source: Isabelle et le vélo, ""Place de Catalogne: From a Racetrack to a Square for All,"" November 15, 2020).

Finally, the social utility of the space is questionable since the planted area is protected and closed to the public to safeguard the young saplings. This is an expensive green backdrop to be viewed from afar rather than a usable public park, a limitation of use highlighted during the consultation reports where the legibility of the project and its status as a ""forest"" were already called into question (Source: City of Paris, ""Report of the information day Place de Catalogne"", January 4, 2024).",en-US,fr,1763915516.0,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108463287036006177908/reviews

I've been a very loyal customer for years, and I've even been making donations to you for every sale for years.

But today you've extremely disappointed and humiliated me in front of all the customers.

I was at the stand in the center and I did my little tour, then a volunteer gave me the receipt to pay.

I paid at the central checkout near the toys and, of course, I went to collect my items, except that the bag she gave me to hold the item was too small, so the item fell and made a noise, so I picked it up and put it back in my bag.

A super-unfriendly volunteer standing at the lighting stand approached me and yelled at me, ""You didn't pay for your items."" Shocked by this volunteer's comments, I looked at her, but of course, the lady I paid for was the one who billed me.

And then I went back up the stairs, and another gentleman came running to get me, telling me that the lady downstairs told me I hadn't paid.

Outraged, I showed him the paper with ""pay"" written on it.

And I replied, ""It's a disgrace, sir. I paid and I have the ticket, and you continue to call me a thief even though I have proof.""

Outraged, I saw him come back with my ticket, and he told me it was fine, and I didn't even look at it and headed for the exit.

I'll never give you another cent, and I'll never give you donations again.

This church is located in the VIII district of Paris and has a rich and unusual history. It stands on the site of an old chapel. The construction of this church was carried out until 1784. The architecture is in the neoclassical style. The facade resembles an ancient Roman temple: a portico with four Doric columns, a triangular pediment with a bas-relief and the inscription ""Deo Optimo Maximo sub invocatione Sancti Philippi Apostoli"".
The interior originally consisted of a straight rectangular basilica with a nave of seven arches, side galleries, and a vault made of wooden coffers.

ChIJf4kfC8pv5kcR2cI_mGvVxtE,Azar,5,"The Church of Saint-Augustin (Église Saint-Augustin) is a unique architectural and historical monument. Built between 1860 and 1871 by architect Victor Baltar, it became the first major religious building in Paris to use a visible cast iron and steel metal frame combined with stone cladding. This innovative approach for its time made it possible to create an impressive interior space without traditional buttresses, giving the building an unusual appearance at the junction of industrial and eclectic styles. The church was conceived as part of Baron Haussmann's urban planning scheme for the transformation of Paris, and it was intended to serve as an architectural landmark at the intersection of the Boulevard Malherbe and the Boulevard Haussmann, completing the perspective from the direction of the Madeleine Church. With its 80-meter-high dome and 100-meter-long structure, Saint-Augustin is one of the largest churches in the city. The architectural style of Saint-Augustin is eclectic, combining elements of Romanesque, Byzantine, and Gothic architecture. The facade is adorned with an 8-meter-diameter stained-glass rose, reinforced with cast-iron armature. Inside, the gilded cast-iron columns, decorated with polychrome angels by Louis Schroeder, and the dome paintings by William Bouguereau, are noteworthy.
One of the unique features of the church is its layout: the building has a trapezoidal shape, where the chancel is wider than the facade, and the side chapels gradually expand as they approach the choir.
The church is also famous for its musical organs: the main organ, created by Charles Spackman Barker, was one of the first in the world to use electricity, and has 54 registers.
Napoleon III planned to make this church the burial place of the Bonaparte dynasty.",en,en,1758038476.0,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107283535278664998432/reviews

ChIJCxVTVUNu5kcRxjXwtjXfWg4,Cláudio Cardona,4,"Tucked away beside the bustling Place du Tertre, the Église Saint-Pierre de Montmartre is a peaceful and historic retreat in the heart of one of Paris’s most vibrant neighborhoods. Often overshadowed by the grandeur of the nearby Sacré-Cœur Basilica, this small but enchanting church offers a quieter, more reflective experience that complements any visit to Montmartre.

As one of the oldest churches in Paris, founded in 1133 and consecrated in 1147, its history is truly remarkable. Built on the site of an ancient Roman temple dedicated to Mars, the church preserves columns and capitals from the Merovingian period, dating back to the 6th and 7th centuries. Its Romanesque and early Gothic architecture blends beautifully with its serene atmosphere, making it a treasure for history and architecture enthusiasts.

Inside, you’ll find a sense of timelessness. The nave and choir, with their elegant ribbed vaults, are particularly captivating. The bronze doors, added in the 20th century, bring a modern artistic touch that contrasts harmoniously with the church’s ancient elements.

If you’re planning a Montmartre itinerary, Église Saint-Pierre is perfectly located to visit before or after the Sacré-Cœur. Its proximity to Place du Tertre, with its lively artists and cafes, makes it a delightful stop for a mix of quiet reflection and Parisian charm.

While not as monumental as other Parisian landmarks, the Église Saint-Pierre de Montmartre exudes a subtle beauty and profound history that leaves a lasting impression.",en,en,1735344515.0,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100397911227828972891/reviews

One thing to know before you go: you must leave your bag in the cloakroom, which is downstairs. It’s free and safe, but it’s better to travel light if you can.

There’s also a small garden behind the museum. It’s a nice quiet place to sit and relax. The entrance to the garden is inside the museum too. It’s worth finding though.

Picasso was a master of traditional art, but he chose to be creative and free, ""like a child"". You can really see that in the artworks on display.

I have worked with galleries, auction houses, and shipping contacts across the US, UK, and EU  and never in my life have I encountered someone as unprofessional, slow, and utterly useless as Marine Viet, the so-called “Director of Shipping and Customs.”

Due to her negligence, lack of basic follow-through, and inability to coordinate even the simplest international art shipment, I was left with a high-value painting stuck in limbo. Zero urgency, zero responsibility, zero awareness. A stray dog in a New Jersey warehouse has more logistical competence than this person.

This is not just about poor communication, it's about institutional rot. Artcurial looks like a high-end French auction house on the outside, but inside it’s a bureaucratic corpse choking on its own arrogance and inefficiency.
Emails go unanswered for weeks. Questions are dodged. No timeline, no clarity, no leadership.

Avoid Artcurial at all costs  especially if you're an international consignor. You’ll be on your own, with no help, no accountability, and no professionalism.

The moment you step inside, you can really feel the calm and sacred atmosphere. It’s simple yet very meaningful, and seeing where the Miraculous Medal originated makes the experience even more special. The church itself is modest but filled with a quiet sense of reverence. The small garden and area outside are also peaceful, perfect for a short reflection or prayer. Definitely worth a visit if you’re in Paris, even if you’re not deeply religious it’s one of those places that just fills you with peace.

ChIJA2RycNNx5kcR2R8Fz59Psy4,Przemyslaw Kowalski,5,"My visit to the Chapel of the Miraculous Medal on Rue du Bac in Paris was an experience I remember mainly because of how the history of the place connects with the physical presence of the bodies of the saints. I already knew about the apparitions of 1830 and that Sister Catherine Labouré had encounters with the Virgin Mary there, but entering the chapel made me realise how close one can actually get to the events described in the accounts.

When I walked inside, I immediately noticed the area connected to the apparitions, including the spot Sister Catherine identified as central to what happened. This made the story, which I had previously known only from descriptions, feel much more concrete. On the right side of the chapel, I saw the body of St. Catherine Labouré. Seeing her incorrupt body made me aware that the person whose experiences influenced the spirituality of so many people really lived there, prayed there, and carried out her work in that environment. On the left side lies the body of St. Louise de Marillac, the co-founder of the Daughters of Charity, whose work had a major impact on the development of charitable care. In a separate part of the chapel, the heart of St. Vincent de Paul is preserved. Seeing these relics made a strong impression on me because they offered a direct connection to people who shaped the history of the Church and its charitable mission.

The interior of the chapel is modest but well maintained. I did not feel any pressure to behave like a tourist. The atmosphere was calm, and the people inside kept silence and respect. This allowed me to focus on what I was seeing and to look at the place not only as a historical site but also as a space that has attracted visitors from around the world for almost two centuries. I felt that the history and the presence of the saints were not just elements on display but an active part of the place.

Leaving the chapel, I had the sense that I had seen a piece of history presented in a direct and tangible way. It is a place that may interest both believers and visitors who want to understand an important element of religious and social life in France.",en,en,1763203078.0,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109153353968383680523/reviews

ChIJA2RycNNx5kcR2R8Fz59Psy4,Jose Gregorio Lepervanche Valencia,5,"On November 27, the Feast of Our Lady of the Miraculous Medal is celebrated. At the entrance of the Chapel of the Miraculous Medal in Paris, next to the Door of Mercy, stands the statue of Saint Vincent de Paul, reminding visitors of the mission of service and charity that inspires this place. Nearby, the figure of the Archangel Saint Michael offers a sign of protection. Very close by, the image of Saint Catherine Labouré, witness of the apparitions of 1830, connects us with the origin of the Miraculous Medal.

The medal shows on its front the Virgin Mary standing upon the world, with rays of light representing her graces; and on its reverse, the M and the cross, the Sacred Heart of Jesus, the Immaculate Heart of Mary, and twelve stars.

ChIJ0U21Qexx5kcR1MofoY5Z8IY,Azar,5,"The square in front of the Church of Saint-Medard is a place with a unique history. It is located in the Latin Quarter, on the site of a former church cemetery.
The history of this place is associated with Jansenism, a movement within Catholicism. In the 18th century, the cemetery was the burial site of François de Paris, a revered Jansenist deacon, and his grave became a place of mass pilgrimage. The followers experienced religious ecstasy accompanied by convulsions, earning them the nickname ""convulsions."" The place became an arena of incredible events: crowds gathered here, some seeking miraculous healing, while others came to gawk at the unusual spectacle.
The unrest became so widespread that in 1732, King Louis XV ordered the cemetery to be closed. The next day, a famous sarcastic inscription appeared on the gates: ""De par le Roy, défense à Dieu de faire miracle en ce lieu"" - ""In the name of the King, God is forbidden to perform miracles in this place.""
In 1875, the cemetery was finally closed, and in its place, the park that exists today was created.
Today, it is a quiet and peaceful park with a fountain and beautiful flowers.",en,en,1763324991.0,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107283535278664998432/reviews

Historical significance:
A center of royal life: The palace was a significant royal residence for centuries, hosting grand parties and being the birthplace of royalty.
A hotbed of revolution: In the 18th century, the gardens became a meeting place for revolutionaries. The rallying cry that led to the storming of the Bastille was famously given here by Camille Desmoulins in 1789.

Modern attractions
Tranquil gardens: The elegant gardens provide a peaceful escape from the city, ideal for a leisurely stroll or a quiet picnic.
Chic shopping: The arcades surrounding the garden are home to upscale designer boutiques, vintage shops, and art galleries.
Modern art: The inner courtyard features the striking black-and-white striped columns of Daniel Buren's ""Colonnes de Buren"" art installation.

ChIJ5bx0qiVu5kcRs_dMpI5ttiY,Azar,5,"This is a historic garden located in the 1st arrondissement, opposite the northern wing of the Louvre. It is part of the architectural ensemble of the Palais-Royal, which includes a palace, a square, and a park.
The garden was established in 1633 and covers an area of 20,850 m². Originally built for Cardinal Richelieu and known as the Cardinal's Palace, it became the royal residence after his death and was renamed the Palais-Royal. Today, the garden is open to the public and is open daily from 8:00 a.m. to 10:30 p.m. It is surrounded by galleries with boutiques and cafes, and is also known for its modern installations, such as the Buren Columns and the Paul Bury Fountain.
The garden features magnolias planted in 1992, which bloom every spring, creating a picturesque sight.
There is also a small bronze cannon that was used as a sundial in the 18th century, firing every day at noon.
The Palais-Royal Garden is an oasis of tranquility and beauty in the middle of a very noisy city.
Interestingly, there are many cafes and restaurants serving Asian cuisine, especially Japanese and Korean, near the garden.",en,en,1758473924.0,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107283535278664998432/reviews

ChIJZe6alItt5kcR1_kKjPo8GKI,Fleur Bleue,5,"Re: James Douglas Morrison (Poet)
Jim was a very complex and gifted individual. He consciously created a revolutionary public persona. But he lived long enough to regret it. He was both handsome and intelligent. In private, he was rather quiet and introverted in contrast to his rock star image. Jim subsequently became an alcoholic. But it permitted him to perform on stage, without being self-conscious. Jim used to walk on edges of buildings. But he had a bad fall prior to his departure to Paris, since he was coughing up blood. As for his death, he apparently purchased heroin in the Rock 'N' Roll Circus Club where he passed away as a consequence due to the combination of alcohol with heroin, which resulted in heart failure. Strange because he was strongly opposed to it since Pamela was using it on occasion.  As for ""The Lizard King"" for the younger admirers, it's tongue-in-cheek. Jim in countless ways was an actor.  Ironically, the idolatry that followed him right to his grave greatly contributed to his death. Jim and Pam are the Romeo and Juliet of pop music. They will remain forever young. (How many rock stars today read Camus, Hegel, Heidegger, Hume,  Kierkegaard, Montaigne, Nietzsche, Plato, Rousseau, Sartre, Schopenhauer and Voltaire?)",en,en,1764685693.0,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101581393324621287463/reviews

There has been a bridge at this location since the 1600s, but this one was built in 1928 (previous bridges having been washed away or demolished).

The bridge has been described as 'intentionally lacking symmetry', not sure exactly what this refers to. Maybe the fact that the small northern arch spans part of the river, while the southern arch spans a walkway - albeit quite likely the walkway is a more recent addition.

Great looking bridge. Of note, there's a statue of St. Genevieve on the south side, she being the patron saint of Paris after having driven Attila's huns away from the city with the power of prayer.",en,en,1714759664.0,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111414447339049575281/reviews

ChIJg4uFtQFw5kcRNUcqhrsealw,Jack Roach,4,"Eglise Note-Dame de Grace de Passy 〰️〰️
I am here as an American, to let you live through
me, the experience of visiting this church. First,
this is not a tourist monument, and it would be
more simple if a local friend took you and found     a parking space on the street. Once that is done,
you will enter an experience that you never knew.
You will enter another world. The quiet creaking
of the old wooden floor. The filtered light coming
through the stained glass windows. The small
wicker chairs that hold you so upright. And also something that I will never forget, a prominent
smell of a combo of candles, many flowers, and burning insense, which fills the whole church.
An organ plays, and a young woman sings with
a voice from heaven. As you later leave, you will ask yourself, ""What is this world on the street,
with a bakery, a fish restaurant, a shoe shop??
I don't know if you are in the mood, but a
combination to this would be the Passy Cemetery which is less than a mile away.
There rests many famous persons, such as
the artist Manet, musicians Faure, Messager,
and Ibert, and Givenchy and Guerlain (perfume)
Let this remind you, as you go away from the big attractions, there is so much history in Paris❗

What sets the Pont de Sully apart from other locations is its unique architecture and design. The bridge boasts intricate details that are a testament to the rich history and culture of Paris.

Although my experience at Pont de Sully was mostly positive, I did notice that some areas could use a bit of maintenance. For example, some of the walkways were uneven and could pose a safety hazard. I would suggest that the owners pay closer attention to the upkeep of the facilities to ensure the safety and comfort of their visitors.

Overall, I would highly recommend a visit to Pont de Sully. It's a stunning location with a rich history and culture that everyone should experience at least once.

7 Pl. des Petits Pères, 75002 Paris, France 🇫🇷

Tucked away in the 2nd arrondissement of Paris, the Basilica of Notre-Dame des Victoires is a peaceful and lesser-known spiritual gem with a rich and fascinating history.

The church was originally built in the 17th century by Louis XIII, who vowed to construct it after a military victory over the Protestants at La Rochelle in 1628 — hence the name “Our Lady of Victories.” Construction began in 1629 and continued over several decades, finally being completed in the 18th century. Over time, the church became a site of deep Marian devotion, attracting the faithful from around the world.

What makes this basilica unique is its collection of over 37,000 ex-voto plaques, letters, and tokens of thanks left by worshippers whose prayers were answered. These offerings, covering nearly every inch of the interior, create a powerful visual testament to centuries of faith and gratitude. It was also here that St. Thérèse of Lisieux experienced a profound spiritual moment — an important stop in her spiritual journey.

In 1927, Pope Pius XI elevated the church to the status of minor basilica, recognizing its religious significance. Today, it remains a quiet refuge in the middle of Paris, a place where history, art, and devotion all come together — often missed by tourists but cherished by those who discover it.",en,en,1754115648.0,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112807399840343673796/reviews

ChIJJSr0RV1l5kcRzbW6FfxF1oU,Azar,5,"It is an art museum and cultural center designed by architect Frank Gehry and opened in October 2014. The initiator of its creation was Bernard Arnault, the head of the LVMH group, who, after visiting the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao in 2001, suggested that Gehry build a chic Art Nouveau center. The project was officially announced in 2006, and construction was carried out from 2008 to 2014 on the territory of the Bois de Boulogne, on a site leased from the city of Paris for 55 years. The building is made in the deconstructivist style and consists of two main elements: the so-called ""iceberg"", formed by blocks of white ultra-strong concrete, and twelve giant glass ""sails"" with a total area of 13,500 m2, which seem to wrap around it. To implement this complex project, advanced 3D modeling technologies were used at that time, and each of the 3,600 glass and 19,000 concrete panels had to be manufactured individually. The 7,000 m2 building houses 11 exhibition galleries, 350-seat classrooms, a restaurant and multi-level terraces with views of the Eiffel Tower and La Defense Towers.

ChIJ0ZC_-lpu5kcRZoHJb3tG4QA,Carlos Rangel,5,"Tucked into one of Montmartre’s quieter corners, Place Dalida and the Buste de Dalida felt like a small reward at the end of our uphill wandering. My wife and I had just taken a break at Square Suzanne Buisson, and from there we continued along Rue Simon Dereure, a lovely residential street lined with typical Parisian façades and small balconies filled with plants. The further we walked, the fewer tourists we saw, and Montmartre slowly shifted from busy postcard to lived-in neighbourhood.

At the end of Rue Simon Dereure a short staircase leads down to a narrow passageway. It’s not difficult, but it’s worth noting for anyone with mobility issues that there are steps and some uneven surfaces, so good shoes are definitely recommended. The alley itself feels almost secret, framed by stone walls and houses, and soon opens onto Place Dalida – a small, cobbled square surrounded by trees and classic Montmartre buildings.

In the middle stands the Buste de Dalida, a bronze sculpture of the beloved singer set on a granite plinth. Dalida, who lived in Montmartre and became a true icon of French music from the 1950s onwards, is honoured here with a monument inaugurated in the late 1990s, sculpted by Aslan as a tribute from the city and her fans. The atmosphere is gentle and slightly nostalgic, as if the square were holding its breath for her. From this spot you also get a beautiful view of the dome of Sacré-Cœur in the distance, perfectly aligned with the sloping street and the lampposts – a scene that begs to be photographed. We took our time capturing a few shots of us together with the basilica discreetly watching over the hill behind us.

Of course, we also joined in the little local tradition: gently touching the statue for good luck. It feels a bit playful and cheeky, but it’s part of the charm – one of those small rituals that connect you, briefly, with all the other travellers who have passed through this tiny square.

There are no facilities directly on Place Dalida: no public toilets, cafés or shops on the square itself, which helps preserve the quiet atmosphere. The closest restrooms are back at Square Suzanne Buisson, so it’s good to plan a quick stop there if needed before continuing your walk. If you need to grab a coffee or a snack, you’ll find plenty of options a short walk away on the busier streets of Montmartre – especially toward Lamarck-Caulaincourt or Abbesses, both of which also have Metro stations that make the area easy to reach. Just be ready for slopes and stairs; Montmartre is beautiful but not the flattest part of Paris.

For us, this stop was less about ticking off a famous landmark and more about enjoying a small, intimate corner of the district. Standing there, with Dalida’s monument in front of us and Sacré-Cœur in the background, we had a few quiet minutes to breathe, smile, and simply enjoy being together in Montmartre.

If you’re already exploring the area, I would definitely recommend adding Place Dalida and the Buste de Dalida to your walking route. It’s a short detour that offers a mix of history, a touch of superstition, and one of those quietly romantic views that make Paris so memorable.",en,en,1764982192.0,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118250553440585890718/reviews

The Église Saint-Paul-Saint-Louis (French pronunciation: [eɡliz sɛ̃ pɔl sɛ̃ lwi]) is a church on rue Saint-Antoine in the Marais quarter of Paris. The present building was constructed from 1627 to 1641 by the Jesuit architects Étienne and François Derand, on the orders of Louis XIII of France. It was the first church in Paris to break away entirely from the Gothic style and to use the new Baroque style of the Jesuits, and it had an important influence on Parisian religious architecture. It gives its name to Place Saint-Paul and its nearest Metro station, Saint-Paul. Next door to the church is the Lycée Charlemagne, also founded by the Jesuits.",en,en,1749435432.0,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102559300353870600244/reviews

ChIJ2YnjJgBz5kcROgvU3LHtvB4,Guillaume Michel,3,"Edit: The 12th arrondissement newspaper's statement ""3000m2 returned to pedestrians"" is laughable, whether you're for or against the works 🤣 If it were a square that had once been pedestrianized, maybe, but no pedestrian alive in 2025 will have known this square as a pedestrian zone 🤣

The 3-star rating is more of a weighted average of the old square and the new one taking shape 😅
The new square will surely have its advantages (greenery, more space for pedestrians) but its share of disadvantages in terms of traffic (if it doesn't improve) because the space for the four lanes (Boulevard de Reuilly, Avenue Daumesnil, Rue de Reuilly, etc.) is tiny...
One can question the relevance of massive works to redesign a square if the result falls somewhere between [rather worse; barely better].

The advantages I mentioned are quite relative considering the neighborhood, which is one of the richest in green spaces (Bois de Vincennes, Coulée Verte, Pelouse de Reuilly), very wide sidewalks (Avenue Daumesnil, etc.), in short, a pleasant neighborhood to live in, already well-spaced in terms of layout with smooth traffic flow.

ChIJz1tNYUpw5kcRfe4F2NDh5ao,Irma Zandl,5,LOVED this church. It was apparently built at the same time as the Eiffel Tower and the steel used in the interior reflects Paris' fascination with that kind of steel construction. Very dramatic but peaceful. Depending on where you are coming from it is quite a schlep but I found it worthwhile. I also checked out the Montparnasse cemetery while I was here (which is beautiful and where Jean Paul Sartre and Simon De Beauvoir are buried).,en,en,1686903909.0,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101579716857027286357/reviews

ChIJz_1_rsJv5kcR9KeBeNaW04s,Elias A. Saade,5,"""For over 130 years, this majestic church has stood as a silent witness to Parisian history, its walls echoing centuries of faith, art, and transformation. Located just steps from the iconic Champs-Élysées and directly behind the Louis Vuitton flagship store, the Église Saint-Paul-Saint-Louis is a masterpiece of Jesuit Baroque architecture. Commissioned by King Louis XIII and built between 1627 and 1641, it marked a dramatic shift from Gothic to Baroque style in Paris. [Eglise Sai...ch), Paris]
The church’s façade, inspired by the Church of the Gesù in Rome, features Corinthian columns and a striking bell tower. Inside, its lavish decoration was designed to contrast Protestant austerity, with a soaring 195-foot dome, stained glass windows, and a white marble altar that includes fragments from Napoleon’s tomb. Victor Hugo himself donated clam-shell holy water vessels in memory of his daughter. [Eglise Sai...ch), Paris]
Throughout its history, the church has endured revolution, repurposing, and restoration. It was once transformed into a 'Temple of Reason' during the French Revolution before being reinstated as a place of worship in 1802. Today, it remains a cultural and spiritual landmark, with some of its artworks—like a Delacroix painting—occasionally loaned to museums around the world. [Eglise Sai...ch), Paris]

ChIJaeTmmRtx5kcRVoR6HaGIL0w,Azar,5,"The Church of Saint-Séverin in Paris, or Église Saint-Séverin, is located in the heart of the Latin Quarter and is one of the oldest surviving parish churches on the left bank of the Seine.
Its history dates back to the early Middle Ages, when a small chapel was built on this site in honor of Saint Séverin, a hermit who lived here in the 6th century. Since then, the first church has been established here. The current building primarily dates back to the 15th and 16th centuries and is an outstanding example of Gothic architecture in the Parisian school. The church was repeatedly rebuilt after fires and destruction, especially in the 12th and 15th centuries, resulting in a combination of early Gothic and late Gothic elements. One of the most impressive architectural features is the exquisite column in the choral area, which resembles a twisted trunk and symbolizes the Tree of Life. The church also features elegant stained glass windows, including both medieval and modern designs from the 20th century.
The church is famous not only for its architecture, but also for its spiritual atmosphere: for centuries, students and scholars from the Latin Quarter have prayed here, and the organ of Église Saint-Séverin is considered one of the best in Paris and is regularly used for concerts.
The church has well-preserved authentic features of Gothic Paris, almost untouched by time. It's like traveling back in time - walking under the vaults, seeing the darkened columns, especially when evening falls and you find yourself stepping out of the bustling pace of city life.",en,en,1762550533.0,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107283535278664998432/reviews

Situated at the foot of Montmartre, it was built from 1894 to 1904. It is notable for its innovative use of reinforced concrete, a pioneering technique championed by architect Anatole de Baudot. The church blends Art Nouveau aesthetics, characterized by organic forms and decorative ceramic tilework, with Gothic structural elements such as pointed arches. Its iron frame and façade distinguish it from traditional Parisian churches, reflecting early 20th-century architectural experimentation.[1][2]

This iconic bridge offers breathtaking views of the Seine River and the surrounding cityscape. The ambiance is peaceful and romantic, making it an ideal spot for a leisurely stroll or a picnic with loved ones.

The bridge's design is a perfect blend of historical and modern elements, making it an architectural masterpiece. The service provided by the staff is excellent, and they go out of their way to make visitors feel welcome. The bridge is well-maintained, and the quality of the experience offered is exceptional.

What sets Pont d'Austerlitz apart from other bridges in Paris is its unique history and location. It was constructed in the early 1800s, making it one of the oldest bridges in the city. It connects the 5th and 12th arrondissements and provides a crucial transportation link between the two.

There are no complaints or criticisms about this beautiful bridge, making it worthy of a perfect 5-star rating. However, it would be even better if more seating areas were added for visitors to relax and enjoy the views.

Overall, I would highly recommend Pont d'Austerlitz to anyone looking for a quintessential Parisian experience.

ChIJM1tDaRlu5kcR7kL2A-OC9Bc,Brad,3,"This is a Roman Catholic parish church on Rue Saint Denis in the 1st District of Paris. It is not far north of Pompidou and can be conveniently viewed when sightseeing in the area.

Originally constructed in the 13th-century, numerous enlargements and modifications took place up until 1780, providing the bulk of the present church you see today. Recent church history is also much associated with the relics of Saint Helena, mother of early 4th-century ruler Emperor Constantine, which were transferred to the church in the late 19th century.

Due to the narrow street in front of the church, it is a bit challenging to appreciate the facade and immediate exterior of Eglise Saint-Leu-Saint-Gilles. However, you can enjoy a simple Gothic facade with side turrets on both sides of the entrance.

We further found the interior to be quite dark throughout. You can walk through the nave, viewing a fine alter with surrounding decoratively carved columns and a nicely carved pulpit. However, it was rather difficult taking pictures due to poor light conditions on the day.

There are nice stained-glass windows to see. However, quite a few within the upper level of the church were missing, at present being replaced with temporary clear glass panes. Would be nice to see the interior with replacements window panes at some point in the future.

In the end, we liked Eglise Saint-Leu-Saint-Gilles but found it more difficult to enjoy given the dark conditions on the day we visited. Will have to give her another visit in the future so that we can better view and appreciate the church.",en,en,1551065097.0,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117832408789555351833/reviews

Located just a few steps from the famous Centre Pompidou, Église Saint-Merri is one of the oldest and most beautiful Gothic churches in Paris. It was built between 1515 and 1612 and named after Saint Mederic (Saint Merri), a 7th-century priest who lived and was buried here.

The church is known for its stunning Gothic architecture, stone carvings, and colorful stained-glass windows. Inside, visitors can enjoy peaceful prayer, organ concerts, and a glimpse of Paris’s medieval spirit.

Unfortunately, like many historical monuments, it faces restoration challenges, but it still remains a beloved spiritual and cultural spot for locals and tourists alike.

It’s basically a huge wall covered with the phrase “I love you” written in over 300 different languages. Yeah, it’s pretty much a love explosion! The wall was created by two artists, Frédéric Baron and Claire Kito, who wanted to create a place celebrating love in all its forms and languages. It’s located in a small square called Jehan Rictus Square, tucked away near the famous Sacré-Cœur Basilica.

The wall itself is made of blue tiles with the words painted in white and red, and it’s about 40 square meters in size. What’s really special about it is that it’s not just for couples, it’s for everyone who believes in love, whether that’s romantic love, friendship, or just a general good vibe. Visitors often stop by to take selfies, leave notes, or just soak in the positive energy. It’s a perfect spot for a chill moment during a busy day of sightseeing.

So, if you’re in Montmartre, make sure to swing by the Wall of “I Love You.” It’s a simple, sweet reminder that love is universal, and it’s found in every language around the world.",en,en,1750758205.0,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117991758272607395005/reviews

2 - View of the Rue Dieu swing bridge, which, following a deliberation by the Paris Council in early October 2024, became the Bernadette Lafont Bridge, named after the late famous French actress.

Bernadette Lafont Bridge - (since 25/09/2024 - formerly the Rue Dieu swing bridge)

It crosses the basin of the Canal Saint-Martin, near the Allibert footbridge.

HISTORY OF THE CANAL SAINT-MARTIN:
4.5 km long, including more than 2 km underground, the canal connects the Bassin de la Villette to the Seine with a drop of 25 meters.
Inaugurated in 1825, it has 9 locks, two swing bridges, and a lift bridge. It is open to navigation 365 days a year. All locks are manned.

Construction of the 4.5-km-long Canal Saint-Martin began in 1805 at both ends, but was not completed until 1825 due to the difficulty of fitting such a structure into an already heavily urbanized site.

During the Second Empire, Prefect Haussmann, wishing to create the Boulevard du Prince-Eugène (Boulevard Voltaire), encountered difficulties with the canal's presence, which would have required a movable bridge, an unacceptable feat for a major road intended to carry heavy traffic.
Engineer Belgrand solved the problem by moving the Bastille locks approximately two kilometers upstream, which lowered the canal between the Bastille and Rue du Faubourg-du-Temple by approximately five meters, thus allowing for the construction of a fixed bridge to cross the new boulevard. Deepening the canal created a trench and eliminated all ports.

Prefect Haussmann therefore decided to complete the project by covering the canal with an arch between the Bastille and Avenue de la République, thus creating Boulevard Richard-Lenoir. The entire project was completed between 1860 and 1862.
In 1906, work on covering the Canal Saint-Martin resumed. A new arch, the Temple Arch, was built as an extension of the Richard-Lenoir Arch. Thus, Boulevard Jules-Ferry was born.
The section that remained open to the sky was rebuilt in 1890 and redeveloped in 1999 and 2002.

Two swing bridges (Bernadette-Lafont Bridge - formerly the Rue Dieu Swing Bridge and Maria Pacôme Bridge - formerly the Grange aux Belles Bridge) and a lifting bridge (the Crimée Bridge) replaced the old wooden structures towards the end of the 19th century.

The famous footbridges date from the second half of the nineteenth century.
Note that the Arsenal Basin connects the Canal Saint-Martin to the Seine, between the Quai de la Rapée and the Place de la Bastille.
It was once a cargo port; today, it is a marina.

CINEMA:
It is on this famous canal and in this neighborhood that Marcel Carné's famous 1938 film, ""Hôtel du Nord,"" and its famous line between Arletty and Louis Jouvet, ""Atmosphere, atmosphere, do I have an atmospheric face..."", are supposed to have taken place.

The film was shot entirely in the studios and the reconstructed hotel. All by Alexandre Trauner, one of the most famous production designers in world cinema.

PERSONAL ANECDOTES:
Living on Rue Dieu...

I lived not far away many years ago, on the other side of Place de la République, on the edge of the Marais.
A stone's throw from the Carreau du Temple covered market.

Back then, the neighborhood wasn't as bourgeois and dirty.

On summer evenings (and in winter too), I liked to stroll along the waterfront.
There was no one there.
I would meet two or three people. It was peaceful.

Today, for at least 15 or 20 years, it has become ""trendy"" and dirty.
The flâneurs are disrespectful of the place and the community.

ChIJn4il3DZl5kcR9Fe6wN4Cre0,Nathalie González López,5,"I'd dreamed of seeing a Shakespeare play at this theater for twelve years. For various reasons, I hadn't yet had the opportunity. Last weekend, I was finally able to realize this dream with my husband. The venue is absolutely magnificent, magical, and the cast far exceeded my expectations. The welcome at the refreshment bar was also very warm.

I would first like to thank the team for this wonderful experience. However, I would like to share a small criticism that, unfortunately, somewhat tarnished the experience.

This summer's sun was particularly intense, and I suffered greatly from the heat during the performance, despite the charming little straw hats provided by the theater. I am undergoing medical treatment that increases my sensitivity to the sun, and I have a disability that makes it difficult for me to sit on the floor. A few minutes before the end of the show, having no water and feeling very uncomfortable, I sat in a shaded corner of the stage with a beer (purchased at the refreshment bar, where I had been told it was permitted to drink during the play).

At the end of the performance, I wanted to sincerely thank one of the actors for the quality of the performance. Unfortunately, this moment turned into a public reprimand, as the actor criticized me for my disrespect by sitting in an area visible from the stage. I want to point out that no one on the staff had indicated to me that my presence in that area was a problem. If this was perceived as a lack of consideration, I deeply apologize. My gesture was not intentional; it was simply a reaction to genuine physical discomfort.

Perhaps in the future, in such weather conditions, it would be possible to provide a few additional shaded areas for the audience. This would help avoid this type of misunderstanding and preserve the magic of this wonderful experience.

Once again, thank you to the entire team, and my sincere apologies to the cast.",en-US,fr,1751283466.0,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103222876009488542917/reviews

What makes me rate it a two, though, is the despicable security at the top entrance. Sorry, it makes me feel better to say it, but even knowing that those guards have a difficult job, one just yelled at everyone asking for info (Info! Are you kidding!?), shouting, ""Go to the line like everyone!"" (He even yelled this at those who went to the MK2 cinema... ""Go to the line!! Oh... okay, you can go... but watch out! I see you!"").

Many of us are occasional visitors with specific research to do, and at the lower entrance, a few of us were misinformed, being told it opened at 13:00. An error is human, and this lady was nice! But then the upper guard shouted for ""everyone up!"". When we asked about the time, his first reflex was to yell, ""Go to the line!"" before finally explaining that it opened at 14:00.

He didn't tell us, though, that only the administrative area was open and that no books were accessible. That was one hour and a half lost, not counting the other hour and a half to get there.

ChIJuyywhtht5kcRas0EijVovak,ChefLaurent DE,5,"The Rotonde de la Villette is a historic building located in the 19th arrondissement of Paris, France. It is situated in the Parc de la Villette, a large public park in the northeastern part of the city.

The Rotonde de la Villette was originally built in the 1780s as a toll gate for the entrance to the city of Paris. It served as one of the gateways to the city, collecting taxes from merchants and travelers entering through the Villette neighborhood. The building was designed by Claude-Nicolas Ledoux, a prominent architect of the time known for his neoclassical style.

Today, the Rotonde de la Villette serves as a cultural and artistic venue within the Parc de la Villette. The building has been restored and transformed into a multipurpose space that hosts various events, exhibitions, and performances throughout the year. It is managed by the Parc de la Villette and is a popular destination for both locals and tourists.

The Rotonde de la Villette is characterized by its circular shape and impressive architectural features. It has a neoclassical design, with columns, pilasters, and a prominent dome. The building is made of stone and stands out amidst the greenery of the park.

Within the Rotonde de la Villette, you can find a café and restaurant, which provide a pleasant place to relax and enjoy a meal or a drink. The venue also houses a theater, where you can catch performances ranging from theater plays to concerts and dance shows.

The Parc de la Villette itself is a vibrant cultural and recreational hub in Paris. It offers a wide range of activities, including gardens, playgrounds, outdoor cinema screenings, music festivals, and interactive exhibitions. The park is also home to several other notable architectural structures, such as the Cité des Sciences et de l'Industrie (Science and Industry Museum) and the Philharmonie de Paris (a concert hall).

The Rotonde de la Villette, with its historical significance and cultural offerings, is a must-visit attraction in Paris. Whether you're interested in history, art, or simply enjoying the beauty of the park, the Rotonde de la Villette offers a unique and enriching experience.",en,en,1693681601.0,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108476250316059010534/reviews

ChIJw6acQWxj5kcRGALwy44saj8,Myriam Colonie,1,"We called on Alvine to organize:
- The decorations
- The day-of coordination
Several negative elements emerged:
We met Alvine three weeks before the wedding to hand over all the decorations we had purchased.
We spent a fortune buying decorations (including 80 lanterns). These were supposed to be displayed in the hall, but despite Alvine's visits to the wedding venue, she realized at the last minute that it was impossible to put them up high and hadn't anticipated this. So at 11 p.m., she started putting them up in the grounds in front of the guests...
We had ordered a canvas that was to be at the entrance to our reception venue, but there was no sign of the canvas.
We had planned to display about ten signs; none were displayed at the wedding venue.
During the installation of the secular ceremony, one of our guests helped her set up some equipment. (Even though everything was supposed to be ready before the guests arrived)
Our friends and family told us that Alvine had been extremely aggressive and disorganized during the telephone preparation of the surprises.
And so on!!!
Alvine justified herself by email after the wedding, telling us that she had planned additional decorative elements, and that we should thank her for that, and that it was the Domaine's fault if everything wasn't ready because the Domaine was obviously late on many things... we later received confirmation from the Domaine that the on-site managers were indeed on time and that it was indeed Alvine who was late.

This lady possessed a captivating charm, commanding the room with a magnetic presence not unlike a leading actress in a period film. Her energy transported us into the whimsical world of the vintage amusement park with such vivacity that one felt entirely immersed.

Within the grounds, one finds a treasure trove of antique delights: a beautifully restored carousel, a mechanical horse-racing game, and a rotating bicycle contraption, all singular and enchanting experiences one seldom encounters elsewhere.

ChIJjx37cOxv5kcRPWQuEW5ntdk,Roderick Luna,5,"Not my first time in Paris, but I’m surprised I only discovered today that you can actually climb the Arc de Triomphe. Enter through the underground passage — much safer than crossing the roundabout — and today being Sunday, entrance was free, which was a great bonus.

It was raining on and off, but that didn’t take away from the experience at all. In fact, reaching the top was the highlight of the day. The 360° views of Paris are incredible, and seeing the Eiffel Tower from above feels completely different from seeing it at street level.

For anyone visiting — even if you’ve been to Paris multiple times — going up the Arc is absolutely worth it. It offers a fresh perspective on the city and some of the best photo spots you’ll find. Highly recommended.",en,en,1765119567.0,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108425840847991149946/reviews
ChIJjx37cOxv5kcRPWQuEW5ntdk,Shunichi Suzuki,5,"【Quick Summary】A spectacular view of Paris at night! The illuminated Arc de Triomphe and the sparkling Eiffel Tower view from the top are absolutely breathtaking.

【Purpose of Visit】Perfect for an evening visit, especially for night view appreciation, right after checking in on your arrival day.

✅ Experience (Highlights)
After a flight from Tokyo, we checked into the hotel around 4 PM and headed straight to the iconic Arc de Triomphe.

* ✅ The View from the Arc: While the illuminated Arc de Triomphe itself is grand and full of charm, **the Eiffel Tower's sparkle illumination (Champagne Flash) seen clearly from the top of the Arc is truly unmissable.**
* By visiting during the transition from dusk to night, we enjoyed a complete panorama: the grandeur of the Arc, the lights along the Champs-Élysées, and the dazzling sparkle of the Eiffel Tower.

* ✅ Final Impression: I believe everyone who witnesses this view will fall in love with Paris. It was a magical moment—the highlight of a perfect Parisian evening.",en,en,1762630328.0,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118063054786331074679/reviews
ChIJjx37cOxv5kcRPWQuEW5ntdk,Ariane Paré,5,"The Arc de Triomphe is absolutely worth going up. The climb is a bit of a workout, but the view at the top makes it more than worth it. Looking out over the Champs-Élysées and the Eiffel Tower is astonishing, especially at sunset.

The atmosphere at the top is surprisingly calm compared to the busy traffic circle below. It also has a romantic feel to it, and it’s a great spot for a proposal or a special moment.",en,en,1764907149.0,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106333193890413446663/reviews

I was able to climb the Arc de Triomphe where you can see Paris city's. You can also see Le Champ Elysee which is  a very popular street in Paris.

ChIJjx37cOxv5kcRPWQuEW5ntdk,Louie Farhat,5,"Visiting the Arc de Triomphe for the first time was truly amazing. Standing beneath this monumental arch, I could really feel the weight of history and the beauty of its design. Every carving and detail tells a story, and being there in person made me appreciate it so much more than just seeing it in pictures. Climbing the 284 steps to the top was a challenge, but absolutely worth it—the view of Paris stretched out in every direction, with the Eiffel Tower standing tall and the Champs-Élysées looking endless. The view was breathtaking and made the whole experience unforgettable. It’s one of those places that captures the magic of Paris in a single moment.",en,en,1759434243.0,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107211163946124799833/reviews
